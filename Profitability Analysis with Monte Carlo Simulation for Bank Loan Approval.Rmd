## Case Introduction and Analysis Objective

Crawford Development Co. (CDC) approached Southeast Bank of Texas (SBT) for a $38.375 million loan to fund a real estate project in Houston for office or residential development. The loan was structured as a bullet payment with a 7% annual interest rate payable at the end of the loan term.

The objective of this case analysis is to determine the optimal loan arrangement for Southeast Bank of Texas (SBT) in financing a real estate development project proposed by Crawford Development Co. (CDC). This involves conducting a comparison of a residential and an office project, analyzing historical data of CDC's past office projects, and utilizing a methodology that includes sales forecast simulation, cash flow simulation, net present value (NPV) calculation, and interest rate sensitivity analysis. The ultimate goal is to identify the project with the highest potential for success, and to recommend an interest rate that will maximize profits for both CDC and SBT.

## Preliminary Analysis and Information

**1. Comparison of Residential and Commercial Projects**

The initial financial analysis of the profitability of the office park and residential neighborhood project options (Table 1 Below) for CDC and SBT reveals that both project options are profitable for both CDC and SBT. The estimated cumulative CDC Free Cash Flow (FCF) for both Office Park and Residential are $10,142,000 and $9,088,000 respectively while the estimated cumulative SBT FCF for both Office Park and Residential are the same at $8,636,030. The higher Office Park project FCF for CDC might suggest that this project is more profitable over the residential project. It is essential to note that these estimates are based on several assumptions and projections about future market conditions, construction costs, and other factors that may affect the profitability of each project option.

![Table 1: Comparison of Residential and Commercial Projects](table1.png){width=50%}


**2. Office Building Development Historical Data**

Table 2 below displays historical data on three-year business development loans from SBT to CDC for constructing office buildings in Houston, Texas. SBT observed that the difference between stated and realized sales for office projects was associated with the leading indicator of economic outlook because changes in the economic outlook can affect the demand for office buildings and, therefore, impact the actual sales of CDC's projects.
For example, if the economic outlook is optimistic, there may be more demand for office space, resulting in higher realized sales than initially stated. Conversely, if the economic outlook is pessimistic, there may be less demand for office space, resulting in lower realized sales than initially stated. A correlation between the leading indicator of the economic outlook and the difference between stated and realized sales for CDC's office building projects might be able to assist in the deep dive analysis for the loan proposal analysis.

## Methodology and Process

**1. Assumptions**

Before building the model, a set of the following assumptions are made based on historical market data and transaction data between CDC and SBT:

1) The current indicator for the office project would follow the historical average of previous economic outlooks.

2) The gap between realized (actual) sales and stated expected sales are normally distributed under each leading indicator of economic outlook (-1, 0, 1)

3) The outlook for residential projects would follow the triangular distribution with most likely of $42.3M, lower bound = $20M and upper bound = $130M.

4) The initial construction costs in the residential project are distributed in triangular distribution with the most likely = $20M, lower bound = $18M, upper bound = $22M.

5) Construction costs of office projects and the rest for residential projects are certain.

**2. Sales Forecast Simulation**

Using the assumptions above, sales of each project are forecasted:

For the office project, a mean and standard deviation of the difference between realized (actual) sales and stated expected sales grouped by its historical economic outlook are first computed. Then, Monte Carlo simulation of normal distribution with the derived mean and standard deviation is run by 10,000 trials, with taking consideration of probabilities of historical average of the economic outlook: 12/32, 9/32, and 11/32 for a pessimistic, neutral, and positive economic outlook, respectively.

For the residential project, Monte Carlo simulation of triangular distribution is run by 10,000 trials, bounded by sales of zero, defining that the sales would not be negative.

Below are the step by step approach to simulate the sales forecast

**3. Cash Flow Simulation**

After sales forecast, cash flow forecast simulation is conducted separately for CDC and SBT

1) Cash flow simulation for CDC

A primary reason for cash flow simulation for CDC is to account for uncertainty of initial construction costs for residential projects and the nature of a contract that the bank would keep the proceeds from CDC’s sales if it does not meet the amount owed to the bank for principal and interest, a total of $47M.

As assumed that the initial construction costs for the residential projects would follow a triangular distribution with the most likely of $20M, lower bound of $18M, and upper bound of $22M, Monte Carlo simulation for the initial construction costs are generated by 10,000 trials.

According to loan customs, any sales that are less than the amount owed in principal and interest ($47M), it will not be distributed to the debtor (CDC), hence recording them as zero sales. Accounting for factors above, cash flow in both projects for CDC would be sales minus various costs (land, construction, sales and marketing, and repayment of principal and interest.

2) Cash flow simulation for SBT

Cash flow for SBT is the function of sales and costs of CDC over the three years of a loan period. In other words, an initial cash outflow is a fixed value of a loan and repayment of principal and interest would be uncertain in three years.

As mentioned, SBT will be a guaranteed beneficiary of a whole repayment of principal and interest, or any cash generated by CDC’s sales if under $47M.

Below are the step by step approach to simulate the cash flow

**4. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation and Testing**

After cash flow simulation, it is crucial to discount the projected cash flows into the present value to compare two projects apples to apples. To derive the present value, projected cash flows will be discounted to the present value by a discount rate, which is 7% for CDC (a lending rate) and 6% for SBT (cost of funds), respectively.

Then, two sample t-tests are implemented to perform a comparison between office and residential projects for CDC and SBT and examine whether the projects would result in a statistically significant difference between their distributions of NPV.

**5. Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis**

Lastly, a sensitivity analysis of a lending rate from SBT to CDC is executed to discover the highest expected value that will be brought to SBT, as the probability of CDC accepting a loan from SBT would decline by 25% for each additional percentage point from a starting lending rate of 7%.

```{r}

## Results and Discussion

**1. Sales Forecast**

- Office Park Project

The simulation of the sales forecast for office park suggested that within the next three years (2008, 2009, and 2010), the office park sales will be in the positive territory of 55,000,000, 75,000,000, and 66,000,000 USD consecutively. The forecasted sales for office park is associated with the outlook economic trend indicator of -1, 1, and 0 consecutively. This means that the year 2008 is forecasted to have pessimistic outcome, year 2009 is forecasted to have optimistic outcome, and the year 2010 is forecasted to have a neutral outcome. 

- Residential Project

The sales simulation also suggests that sales for residential projects for the next three years (2008, 2009, and 2010) will be in the positive territory of 60,000,000, 100,000,000, and 30,000,000 USD consecutively. 

Even though both projects forecasted sales are all in the positive territory, the forecasted sales for office park seems to be more stable (low standard deviation) compared to the forecasted sales of the residential project (high standard deviation), suggesting that the office park project might have a lower spread risk.

**2. Net Present Value Analysis (NPV) Results**

- NPV for Crawford Development Co: Office Park Project

As the office park project sales is heavily affected by the economic outlook indicator thus inducing uncertainty in the last part of the cashflow, the simulated Net Present Value (NPV) for the Office Park project showed solid positive results with mean of 8,947,786 USD and

standard deviation of 8,068,282 USD. The simulated NPV seems to follow a Normal Distribution with a symmetrical tail. Even though not all simulated values fall within the positive territory, the majority of the simulated NPV for Office Park falls within the positive range with the proportion of the negative NPV, out of 10,000 simulation iterations, counted only at 16.3%. This suggests that 83.7% of the times, the Office Park project would expectedly return a positive NPV for the Crawford Development and Co. The histogram of CDC Office Park project is available at the Appendix 4.

- NPV for Crawford Development Co: Residential Project

The simulated NPV as a function of simulated free cash flows for Residential projects, also showed some strong positive results like the Office Park with the mean NPV at 8,523,096 USD and standard deviation of 19,335,363 USD. The simulated NPV of Residential also falls within two regions of positive and negative with the proportion that falls into negative regions accounts for as much as 39.5%.

The above result hinted that the Office Park project returned higher simulated NPV compared to the residential project. The difference between the two means of the simulated NPV is also statistically significantly different at alpha level of 0.05 with p-value at 0.0426. The lower standard deviation of the Office Park also hinted that it is a relatively safer bet compared to the Residential project due to lower spread risk. Based on the result, the Office Park project would be a better choice for CDC.

- NPV for Southeast Bank of Texas: Office Park Project

As for Southeast Bank of Texas, the simulated NPV for Office Park also returned positive mean NPV at 3,365,065 USD and standard deviation of 430,737 USD with a relatively low proportion of the simulated NPV that falls within the negative region at only 0.44%. This means that most of the time, the simulated NPV for Office Park project from the perspective of SBT would yield positive results.

- NPV for Southeast Bank of Texas: Residential Project

The simulated NPV for Residential Project on the perspective of SBT also returns a positive mean NPV at 1,089,634 USD with standard deviation at 4,736,900 USD. The proportion of simulated NPV that is less than zero accounted for 21.73% which is significantly higher than the Office Park project.
The result above clearly shows that the Office Park project is better than the Residential project for SBT as it returned higher NPV with lower spread risk. The difference between the mean of the NPVs also is statistically significantly different at alpha level of 0.05 with p-value of 0.00000000000000022. All of the graphs for simulated NPV are available at Appendix 4.

**3. Optimum Interest Rate**

The sensitivity analysis for the different interest rate and given probability of CDC accepting the loan interest proposal showed that SBT would get the maximum expected value of the profit + interest, around 50,000,000 USD when the interest rate is at 7% (current proposal). This would also allow SBT to maintain the good long-standing relationship with CDC and thus increase its Customer Lifetime Value.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

Results above show a clear conclusion: SBT should proceed with the current arrangement to lend CDC a loan of $38.375 million with interest rate of 7% and suggest CDC to continue with office park development projects to maximize profit. In addition to that, SBT could also do the following recommendations to add value and reduce SBT`s risk of this loan arrangement:

1. Consider negotiating with CDC for the possibility to increase their equity part of the project to reduce the loan amount thus potentially reducing default impact by giving incentives of lower loan interest if CDC is willing to increase their equity.

2. Conduct a detailed analysis of CDC`s financials and track record to assess their ability to successfully complete the project and repay the loan

3. Establish clear communication channels with CDC to ensure that both parties are aligned on project goals, timelines, and expectations.

4. Consider requiring CDC to provide collateral or personal guarantee to secure the loan and reduce SBT `s risk exposure.

5. Monitor the progress of the project closely and conduct regular site visits to ensure that construction is proceeding according to plan.

6. Consider partnering with other banks or financial institutions to share risk and diversify SBT`s exposure to the potential risk.

7. Consider using loan insurance for the events of default.
